Project description for the 2019 edition of the Web Languages and Technologies course.


## OBJECTIVE

Create a website where owners can list their houses and apartments for tourists to rent. To create this application, students should:

- Create a sqlite database where data about users and rentals is stored.

- Create documents using HTML and CSS that represent the web pages of the application.

- Use PHP to generate those web pages after retrieving/changing data from the database.

- Use Javascript to enhance the user experience (for example using Ajax).


## REQUIREMENTS

#### The minimum expected requirements are the following:

### All users should be able to (users can be simultaneously owners and tourists):

- Register a new account.

- Login and logout.

- Edit their profile (username and password at least).

### Owners should be able to:

- Manage their own places for rental. Each place should have a title (e.g., “Cute house near the beach”), a price per day, a location and a description.

- List reservations for their places.

### Tourists should be able to:

- Search for places to rent using several criteria (price, location, dates available, …).

- Rent a place if the place is available.


## EVALUATION

Final Grade: 14.8/20
